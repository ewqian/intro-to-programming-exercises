# What do the following expressions evaluate to? That is, what value does each expression return?

=begin
1. x = 2
  This returns 2. Variable assignment retunrs the value that is assigned

2. puts x = 2
  Since puts is called it'll print 2 but will return nil

3. p name = "Joe"
  The 'p' method returns and prints the same value, in this case "Joe"

4. four = "four"
  This returns "four" aka the value assigned

5. print something = "something"
  The 'print' method behaves similarly to puts and returns nil
=end
